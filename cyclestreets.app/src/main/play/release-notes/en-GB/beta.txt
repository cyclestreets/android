Handle CycleStreets photomap location URLs.
Waypoints shown during LiveRide.
Dates included on photo display dialog.
Active segment now highlighted on the elevation graph.
Modernisation of some icons, using vector graphics for better resolution and smaller install size.
LiveRide now requests audio focus which should improve the experience e.g. when also playing music.
Target streets are now described as part of instructions - e.g. "Get ready to turn right" becomes "Get ready to turn right onto [street name]".
Pressing "back" now takes you back to your previous view, so you don't accidentally minimise the app so often.

Numerous bug fixes.
