            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Cross-posted from our <a href="https://blog.cyclescape.org/">Cyclescape blog</a>:</em></p>
<p>Over the last five years, we&#8217;ve received lots of feedback about our <a href="https://www.cyclescape.org/">Cyclescape</a> website, which started in 2012, as well as much experience ourselves as users.</p>
<p>As a result of funding from our new project <a href="https://www.streetfocus.uk/blog/">StreetFocus</a>, we&#8217;re pleased to announce that we will shortly be starting work on a full-scale redesign of the Cyclescape site. We expect the design work to be finalised in February and will then be rolling out as developer time permits shortly after that.</p>
<p>This will be a full-scale revamp. As well as a fresh visual look and a new mobile-friendly interface, this will tackle seven key areas of usability:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generally, <strong>reorganising screens</strong> to reduce confusion and make the site concepts much clearer and easier to understand;</li>
<li><strong>User onboarding process</strong> is poor &#8211; currently users have to go through far too many screens to get set up;</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight issue reporting</strong> model, so that many more issues can be reported in a more lightweight way;</li>
<li>The <strong>issues map</strong> is unusable when many area-wide issues present &#8211; we want the map to be a stronger focus, and much nicer;</li>
<li>Subscription by <strong>theme</strong>, e.g. ‘cycle parking’ rather than purely by geographical area;</li>
<li>Dealing with <strong>general chat</strong> discussions that are neither geographical nor administrative, which has always never really worked;</li>
<li><strong>Planning application integration</strong> to add new features such as automatically linking to key documents.</li>
</ol>
<p><!--
We'll be working with <a href="https://outlandish.com/">Outlandish</a>, a web development co-op who we have previously worked with on our Bikedata and recently our new StreetFocus sites.
--></p>
<p>Please do take the opportunity to fill in our <a href="https://blog.cyclescape.org/survey/">survey</a> to give us your thoughts on the site.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transport for London <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2019/05/10/tfl-cid/">recently released</a> a major new dataset detailing every piece of cycle infrastructure in Greater London.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re proud to announce that we&#8217;re working with London Cycling Campaign (LCC) on a new project to help maintain that dataset, for TfL.</p>
<p>This project will use LCC’s active volunteers and borough groups &#8211; the people who know how cycling infrastructure in London changes &#8211; to correct and update information for all London Boroughs. The database was surveyed during 2017 and 2018 and thus now needs updating to include all the improvements to cycling put in place since then (and to flag up things that have been removed or that need repair). This is a pilot project to see if large numbers of volunteers can be activated to feed data into this project alongside other partners.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve created a new website, <a href="https://www.londoncyclingdata.org.uk/">London Cycling Data</a>, for LCC to enable just that, and this is now live.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.londoncyclingdata.org.uk/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3504" src="/wp-content/uploads/londoncyclingdata2-e1585504281205.png" alt="" width="600" height="575" /></a></p>
<p>The site interacts with a new suite of data interfaces in the <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/#infrastructuredatasetauditing">CycleStreets API</a>, for infrastructure auditing.</p>
<p>The visual design for the site is by Mike of Primary Image.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://lcc.org.uk/pages/london-cycling-data">read more about the site and the project as a whole</a> on LCC&#8217;s website.</p>

<p>OpenStreetMap was designed to enable ordinary people to create open geodata that anyone can use and maintain easily. Traditional GIS concepts such as layers are dispensed with in order to make editing simple and accessible. In the same way that the web would never have taken off if HTML were not so accessible and tolerant of mistakes, this simplicity in OSM has meant a low barrier to involvement.</p>
<p>However, as OSM is becoming more widely used in the mainstream, the need for accuracy and quality is becoming more and more important. Cyclists need detailed turn data to enable high-quality routing that takes full account of safety. Satnav companies, need lane data, which is difficult to represent accurately. Pedestrian routing is barely in its infancy and high quality routing for people walking or using wheelchairs is hard to achieve.</p>
<p>At its root, OSM tries to represent spaces as flows (lines). This results in fundamental compromises and inaccuracies. What is good for routing is not always good for cartography, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>For instance, a street containing cycleways with pavements either side is usually represented as a single line with attributes. However, it is extremely challenging to represent properly all the parts of the street, and in general people simply don&#8217;t bother: a single line with large numbers of attributes is unwieldy to edit (even when hidden by editor GUIs), and just as challenging for a router to interpret. Continual changes in the width of a street cannot be easily represented without segmenting the street heavily and creating a mess. Temporary disappearance of lanes makes editing complex. Routing ultimately ends up as a lowest common denominator result.</p>
<p>The alternative method of representing this same street is as a series of individual lines. But this is equally problematic. In this model, the street loses its coherence as a single entity &#8211; humans think of it as a street with multiple uses (walking, cycling, driving, trees). Where people have done this, attributes such as street names need to be kept in sync, and in practice separate pavements often fail to have names attached. Concepts such as the ability to cross from one side of the road to the other (or even switch lanes) are not modelled, with the result that a router may take the user to the end of the street then back down. And cartography ends up showing a series of parallel lines which looks messy and does not match the human perception of a street.</p>
<p>The bicycle tagging page on OSM provides a perfect demonstration of the current problem: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bicycle It shows the complexity of representing many common scenarios, with increasingly incomprehensible tagging combinations. No router implements anything like all of this, and even expert OSM contributors would shy away at bothering to add this data.</p>
<p>Cycleways indeed are a good general example of inconsistent tagging. Cycleways separate to a road are sometimes tagged as an attribute of the street and sometimes as a separate geometry. What about a hybrid/stepped cycle lane of the kind seen in Copenhagen &#8211; is that a cycle lane or a cycleway? Do lane counts include cycle lanes or not? How is obstructive car parking represented? Is the one-way indication applicable to the cycle lane on the road? And so on.</p>
<p>Another example is junctions. Should traffic signals be treated spatially (i.e. represent the location of the traffic heads), or should they be treated linearly so that routing works properly? How should the linear model work accurately when there is only a single geometry for multiple directions? Have a look at the roads around the Arc De Triomphe in Paris &#8211; it is completely impossible for a routing engine to work out exactly how many signal delays should actually be attributed based on the presence of the marking of traffic signals in the data: https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/48.87391/2.29536</p>
<p>This talk will discuss these cases, and provide a starting point for discussion on what should be done to improve the situation. As people are ever keener to add more detail to the map, and as more and more mainstream users look to OSM, we have to ask whether the current model is arguably creaking too heavily. Is there a way that we can represent spaces as a set of interconnected flows in some way?</p>
<p>The speaker, Martin Lucas-Smith, is one of the developers of CycleStreets, one of the earliest and most established dedicated cycle routing engines. As such, he has spent many years considering the kinds of tradeoffs represented by the current OSM data model.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Transport for London (TfL) have created a new database of cycling infrastructure, containing 240,000 assets, covering all of Greater London. This is proposed to be released as open data. This groundbreaking database contains every cycle infrastructure asset within Greater London, including assets on and off-carriageway. The assets surveyed are: cycle parking; signals; signage; traffic calming measures; [&#8230;]]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://tflcid.cyclestreets.net/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3417" src="/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_parking-300x202.png" alt="TfL CID" width="300" height="202" align="right" srcset="https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_parking-300x202.png 300w, https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_parking-150x101.png 150w, https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_parking-768x517.png 768w, https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_parking-594x400.png 594w, https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_parking.png 862w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><a class="external text" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">Transport for London (TfL)</a> have created a new database of cycling infrastructure, containing 240,000 assets, covering all of Greater London. This is proposed to be released as open data.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking database contains every cycle infrastructure asset within Greater London, including assets on and off-carriageway. The assets surveyed are: cycle parking; signals; signage; traffic calming measures; restricted points (e.g. steps); advanced stop lines; crossings; cycle lanes/tracks; and restricted routes (e.g. pedestrian only routes).</p>
<p><i>“The world’s first Cycling Infrastructure Database will be the most comprehensive database of cycling infrastructure ever collected in London. Over the past 18 months, TfL has amassed data on every street in London, cataloguing almost 146,000 cycle parking spaces, 2,000 km of cycle lanes and more than 58,000 cycle signs and street markings. This information will be released as open data alongside a new digital map of cycle routes, will make journey planning and cycle parking much easier, as well as offering valuable information to TfL and the boroughs for planning future investment in cycling.”</i></p>
<p>TfL is keen to make this available to the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> community under a compatible open license, to ensure maximum use of the CID. TfL is also potentially willing to consider tool development to help facilitate sensitive merging in of this data. OpenStreetMap is the street data on which CycleStreets is built, so the better data available to OSM, the better our routing can become.</p>
<h3>Demonstrator map</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve created a <strong><a href="https://tflcid.cyclestreets.net/">demonstrator map</a></strong>, <b>for the purposes only of evaluation</b> by the OSM community at this stage.</p>
<p>This demonstrator map contains only <b>one of the 25 areas</b> that have been surveyed.</p>
<p>We are specifically seeking comments on data quality and usefulness of this data from the OSM community. Initial analysis by CycleStreets is that the data is of excellent quality, and very suitable for conflation into OSM, to increase both comprehensiveness and metadata quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://tflcid.cyclestreets.net/"><img class="size-full wp-image-3415 alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_track.png" alt="TfL CID" width="100%" srcset="https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_track.png 860w, https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_track-150x102.png 150w, https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_track-300x203.png 300w, https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_track-768x520.png 768w, https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/tflcid_cycle_track-591x400.png 591w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Usage notes:</b> The controls on the right of the map allow the different feature types to be selected. The OSM layer (available at zoom level 19+) also provides a live feed from the OSM API, to enable quick comparisons. The two photos of each asset are in the process of being supplied; those already available and cleared in GDPR terms are included in the popup.</p>
<p>It is stressed that at this point, no permission is given for re-use of the data in any way, but TfL strongly intends to make this available in future. All 25 areas would be covered in the final data release, not merely the one shown currently in the demonstrator map.</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>Feedback is very strongly encouraged, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please do discuss the data and related aspects noted above on the <a class="external text" href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-gb" rel="nofollow">talk-gb mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Feedback and questions can also be <a href="/contacts/">e-mailed</a> us.</p>
<p>We are happy to provide any clarifications, which will be added to this page, as a central repository of information about the project.</p>
<h2>More detail</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve set up a new <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TfL_Cycling_Infrastructure_Database"><strong>TfL CID project</strong> wiki page</a> on the OpenStreetMap Wiki.</p>

<p><strong>Towards data-driven policy development: the case of London’s built cycling infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>In 2013, £913m of funds was allocated over 10 years for investment in London’s cycling infrastructure. Much of this — including guided quietways, protected cycle superhighways and London’s crossrail for the bike — opened in summer 2016. The chief objective: to make cycling ‘a normal part of everyday life  […] something people hardly think about […and] something everyone feels comfortable doing’ (Greater London Authority 2013).</p>
<p>Traditionally, attempts to evaluate such interventions might rely on survey data describing changes in *claimed* behaviour or high-level data from Automatic Traffic Counters describing infrastructure occupancy. The former are often expensive to collect and suffer from numerous (well-documented) biases and the latter are too high-level to capture more subtle changes in behaviour.</p>
<p>This project will instead use new, large-scale observational datasets – from London’s bikeshare, underground and bus network, from route planning services (CycleStreets.net), user-contributed and social media data —  to describe changes in city-wide cycling behaviours pre- and post- the intervention. Crucially, it will identify rich detail around the impact of current investment on behaviour and contribute quantified estimates, under uncertainty, around the impact of future investment.</p>
<p>Applications are welcomed from those wishing to develop expertise in statistical model building, geospatial data and information visualisation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A techie post, about some cycling data which may be of use to people researching cycling.</em></p>
<p>Back in 2011, we were involved in a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/England_Cycling_Data_project">project to convert some newly-collected cycling data</a> from the UK&#8217;s Department for Transport for use in OpenStreetMap.</p>
<p>The data was originally collected for the DfT&#8217;s Transport Direct project (which has since ceased operation), which was an early attempt to create a government cycle journey planner, launching on almost the same day as CycleStreets itself. In order to ensure that taxpayer value for this expensive (£2.4m) dataset was not lost as Transport Direct fell into disuse, CycleStreets successfully encouraged the DfT to release the data openly and to do so in a way which would encourage use in OpenStreetMap. We helped with that process, and data for cities started to be merged in from 2011.</p>
<p>The data consists of the cycle network as of 2011 in each city of over 30,000 people. This does however <em>not</em> represent all cycle infrastructure &#8211; only where signage is present. Additionally, collection included the Sustrans NCN network.</p>
<p>Since that time, things have moved on. OpenStreetMap has become the go-to datasource for cycling data internationally. GeoJSON has become the de-facto format for open geographical data. Similarly, Github has become the de-facto location to distribute open data like this.</p>
<p>As part of a project we have been working on with Leeds University, the <a href="https://www.cyipt.bike/">Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Toolkit (CyIPT)</a> (which we will report on soon), we needed historical data from 2011, and this DfT data was a perfect candidate.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we have taken the opportunity to recover the data from 2011, and convert it to GeoJSON and republish it, in the hope it might be useful for some people. It is an OpenStreetMap-orientated version of the data published on data.gov.uk. As such it is subject to OSM licensing conditions.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cyclestreets/dft-england-cycling-data-2011"><strong>DfT England Cycling Data 2011</strong></a></p>
<p>We would stress that, for almost all uses, CycleStreets instead <strong>strongly</strong> recommends downloading data from <strong>OpenStreetMap</strong>, which is topographically routable and is maintained and has far greater geographical coverage. Moreover, the cycle network has changed from 2011-18. However, the data in this repository contains attributes on each geometry which remain often more detailed than OSM. Accordingly, the data is most useful for research purposes and for <strong>manual merging into OSM</strong>, which is encouraged.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cyclestreets/dft-england-cycling-data-2011">Full details</a> about the data are given in the README which can be found on the main repository page.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CycleStreets is seeking one or more paid interns to work on a variety of projects this summer.</p>
<h3 class="p1">About CycleStreets</h3>
<p><img class="diagram alignright right wp-image-3375" src="/wp-content/uploads/internship2018.png" alt="" width="350" height="400" align="right" srcset="https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/internship2018.png 620w, https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/internship2018-131x150.png 131w, https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/internship2018-263x300.png 263w, https://www.cyclestreets.org/wp-content/uploads/internship2018-350x400.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></p>
<p class="p1">CycleStreets is a social enterprise based in Cambridge, working to help get more people cycling by the provision of information on cycle-friendly routes, and various tools for use by cycle advocacy groups.</p>
<p>We are best known for our <a href="/">journey planner</a>, aimed at finding practical cycle routes in urban environments. To do that effectively requires collating data from a variety of sources and configuring a routing engine to make the same decisions a knowledgeable cyclist would make to find a route to their destination. We are aiming to provide the highest quality cycle routing in the world that tries to &#8216;think like a cyclist&#8217;.</p>
<p>Our bike routing is used by our own <a href="/">website</a> and apps, as well as in a range of <a href="/mobile/">third-party apps</a> (such as <a href="https://citymapper.com/">Citymapper</a>, <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2016/12/18/bike-hub-app-relaunched/">Bike Hub</a>, London cycle hire apps, etc.), as well as a variety of transport companies (SDG, Virgin East Coast, mxdata, Traveline Wales/Scotland, etc.). It is also being used for <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2015/12/19/bristol-msc-research/">academic research</a> and transport planning, e.g. the <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2016/12/21/propensity-to-cycle-tool/">Propensity to Cycle Tool</a> and <a href="https://www.cyipt.bike/">CyIPT</a> projects.</p>
<p>The website also includes our <a href="/photomap/">Photomap</a> &#8211; around 80,000 user-contributed photos of cycling related infrastructure from around the UK and beyond. These are used by activists to promote good practice and highlight problems to avoid in future. The Photomap also powers Local Authority websites such as the <a href="http://www.urbancycleparking.org.uk/">Urban Cycle Parking</a> website for TfL. Further tools that present <a href="http://bikedata.cyclestreets.net/">transport data</a> that affects cycling are also in development.</p>
<p>CycleStreets also manages <a href="https://www.cyclescape.org/">Cyclescape</a>, a geographically-based discussion forum increasingly used by cycling campaign groups across the UK.</p>
<p>With our limited resources given over to focussing on keeping the core services up-to-date and responsive several areas have been left lagging and with work to do. We have a powerful API suite, but the front-end website and apps do not currently reflect its abilities in design and UI terms.</p>
<h3>A wide range of potential development areas</h3>
<p>Although improvements to our main codebase &#8211; the website &#8211; is our ideal focus, we&#8217;re happy to see work on any of our projects &#8211; routing engine, mobile apps, Cyclescape, etc.</p>
<p>The codebase for the main website is a rich collection of page-generation code, database procedures and webpage classes, system configuration scripts, and a low-level routing engine implementation &#8211; all written in commonly used mainstream languages. The codebase has been reorganised thanks to help from a previous year&#8217;s intern. This codebase primarily consists of over 200 PHP classes, using traditional inheritance/loading techniques, arranged as a fairly purist MVC structure. Much of the core functionality has been converted to a <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/v2/">public API</a> (with over 40 calls in total) that powers the website and third-party apps/sites.</p>
<p>Much of <a href="https://github.com/cyclestreets/">our code is on Github</a> and we are trying to get the main website there too.</p>
<p>Some specific areas which we would welcome help with (though this is not exhaustive) include:</p>
<p><em>1. System coding and refactoring</em></p>
<p>Ours is a large codebase, with large amounts of functionality. There is always plenty of development that can be done throughout the system. Our previous intern&#8217;s work on refactoring was particularly beneficial and further work can be done; new functionality is also very welcome.</p>
<p><em>2. Overall website design, including integration with mobile</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s an opportunity to update how CycleStreets presents itself to give the service a &#8216;personality&#8217; &#8211; particularly on mobile. Here we&#8217;re mainly thinking about the look and feel but also what can be done with it. The codebase can serve webpages based on templates, and these are ready to be used by responsive stylesheets that will work on a variety of screen widths. Developments in this area could provide a major benefit to users on mobile In general, we are aiming to unify our various interfaces into a single implementation.</p>
<p><em>3. Usability</em></p>
<p>Interaction with the journey planner works smoothest on desktop but there is a lot of scope for improving mobile interactivity. Interaction of the journey planner with the map is one area that needs work, but there a lot of small things that would help such as, for instance prompting users&#8217; frequently used locations when they search.</p>
<p><em>4. Cycle route quality</em></p>
<p>Changes to the cycle routing engine are perhaps beyond the scope of a summer intern, unless you are starting from a more advanced base of knowledge. A major challenge is how to know if the suggested cycle route is good &#8211; and whether changes to input data or configuration parameters produce a better route or not. Ideas and developments of the testing regime could make a significant difference to route quality.</p>
<p><em>5. Elevation data</em></p>
<p>The routing engine takes into account the cost of hill climbing and that depends on accurate elevation data. There&#8217;s scope for adding to our library of data provided by countries such as Australia and Finland.</p>
<p><em>6. Geocoding</em></p>
<p>Maintaining an up-to-date way of translating text into a location has proven quite a distraction over the years. We&#8217;d really like to get on top of this issue and resolve it once and for all. It&#8217;s quite a well-defined isolated project, primarily involving sysadmin and code integration work.</p>
<p><em>7. Work on our mobile apps</em></p>
<p>If you have skills in Java for Android or Objective-C/Swift, we would also be willing to consider work on these also. The apps have been created by colleagues rather than the two of us who will be running the internship; accordingly we can&#8217;t provide training on the actual programming languages, but things like code structure and UI would be possible to be covered. A new design has been created and is almost ready to be implemented.</p>
<p><em>8. Bikedata site</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been working to get lots of public data on our new Bikedata site. There are many ideas for development here &#8211; new layers, new features, graphing, visualisations, API improvements, etc.</p>
<h3>About the internship</h3>
<p>This is an opportunity to get involved with a live and dynamic project that faces continual resource challenges. The successful candidate will have a choice of which projects to work on based on their own preferences and ideas. We&#8217;ll provide supervision and work together to define goals and help solve problems.</p>
<p>As an intern, you will be a proper part of the CycleStreets team, as a fully-paid employee over the summer period, with daily training and co-working.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2015/10/01/patrick-reports-back/">Read about how our previous intern, Patrick, found the process.</a></p>
<p>The intern will be hired as an proper salaried employee. Our intern(s) will earn £400 per week, are regarded as part of the team from day one, and the internships last for 10 weeks. We will also come to a flexible arrangement regarding working locations and/or expenses for public area working to ensure that the successful employee is never out-of-pocket.</p>
<p>The paid internship will be based in Cambridge (UK). This is because we feel it is important that there is daily contact as this is aimed to be a two-way process providing lots of training.</p>
<p>As our two current employees work mainly from home, we&#8217;ll expect the intern to find their own workspace as we cannot provide an office environment. We&#8217;ll meet with you to discuss and plan your work schedule and ideas at internet cafés or meeting rooms in Cambridge, as well as online.</p>
<p>We are not expecting someone with many years of development experience, as such a person would be in a stable job, and the salary level is not intended to reflect this. What is more important to us is someone with the right mindset, a fast learner, who can work at a good rate. Being an internship, this will be a two-way arrangement, with us helping give the student knowledge of working in a large codebase and the challenges this brings – though we do want someone who is a self-starter.</p>
<h3>How to apply</h3>
<p>To apply, all we need is your CV and a covering letter, <a href="/contacts/">sent via e-mail</a> by the end of <strong>Monday 30th April 2018. </strong>Your covering letter should explain your interests, and include some thoughts on our site (such as a critical analysis, max 1 page), and point us to any code you have written (public code on Github is always a good sign). Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.</p>
<p>We will contact all applicants by the end of Tuesday 1st May.</p>
<p>Interviews will take place on either 2nd/3rd May, according to your availability.</p>

<p>As campaigners for getting more people cycling, a crucial issue for us is safety of our streets. Safer streets means more people cycling &#8211; as places like the Netherlands and other European cities show.</p>
<p>Every year, the Department for Transport issues a massive data release, detailing every reported road collision in Great Britain, what vehicles were involved, and the outcome in injury terms. Known as STATS19, the data contains around 60 pieces of information for every collision &#8211; whether slight, serious or fatal. This is excellent work by the DfT who collate this.</p>
<p><a href="https://bikedata.cyclestreets.net/collisions/">We&#8217;ve plotted every collision</a>, and made available the full details, on a map on our new Bikedata website.</p>
<p>The data for 2016 has just been released &#8211; we got it online within a few hours of its release.</p>
<p>The site is a beta &#8211; the two things we want to improve are removing the jumpiness of the icons, and dealing with the question of how to show large numbers of collisions when zoomed out &#8211; currently a limit is applied. Zooming in shows all.</p>

<p>Since the data was first made live, we&#8217;ve fixed a few issues. The latitude/longitude values in the original data were incorrect, so we&#8217;ve reprojected these from the northings/eastings values which are the original data. Some data in London was also misnumbered, which the DfT have corrected after we pointed this out. Our interface also was not filtering correctly for car occupants &#8211; now fixed.</p>
<p>For every collision, you can click to get full details &#8211; available openly without charge.</p>

<p>Behind every one of these is a human story:</p>

<p>Users of the site are finding that the visual display enables patterns to be spotted &#8211; such as the way that the typical British roundabout design fails cyclists:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is incredible. Every driver-bike incident in the UK 2005-2016 mapped. Roundabouts are terrible for cyclists, turns out. Data at <a href="https://t.co/yRhStvpvIW">https://t.co/yRhStvpvIW</a> <a href="https://t.co/l8ktNe3dX6">pic.twitter.com/l8ktNe3dX6</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>as do junctions more generally:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just checked my local area and cycling route. Every accident is at a junction or roundabout. Every single one without exception.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>We&#8217;re now working to add new comparison facilities &#8211; we want to bring out the policy implications hidden in this data.</p>
<p>For instance, how do different Local Authorities compare? What happens when streets are upgraded to add safe, segregated infrastructure? How can we most easily demonstrate that allowing two-way cycling in one-way streets is a perfectly safe improvement.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also wanted for a long time to link these to newspaper reports and are considering methods to enable people to do that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a post for app developers. So it contains some techy stuff which probably won&#8217;t be of interest to our cycle routing users.</em></p>
<p>Knowing where you can find cycle parking as a cyclist, especially in cities, is helpful in avoiding theft, as well as helping keeping busy streets tidy.</p>
<p>By providing information on where cycle parking exists, developers of apps can easily help people find cycle parking before they even reach their destination.</p>
<p>CycleStreets provides a <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/v2/pois.locations/">Cycle parking API</a> as one of the points of interest (POI) types that can be retrieved in our extensive <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/">cycling API suite</a>. Developers can embed this in our app &#8211; either by making realtime calls or obtaining the data en-batch using the CSV export mode.</p>
<p>You can see an <a href="http://bikedata.cyclestreets.net/cycleparking/">example implementation</a> on our new Bikedata website:</p>
<p><a href="http://bikedata.cyclestreets.net/cycleparking/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3265 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/cycleparking-1-e1504014605866.png" alt="" width="601" height="296" /></a></p>
<p>The API provides the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locations of all cycle parking in the UK and other areas that we support (much of northern Europe and various cities around the world &#8211; contact us if you need other areas)</li>
<li>Whether the parking is public or private</li>
<li>Number of bikes that can be parked (where data is available)</li>
<li>Details of whether the cycle parking is covered, what type of stands, etc. (where data is available)</li>
<li>The location of the entrance point rather than the centre point (for larger installations, where data available)</li>
<li>(Coming soon) Large areas of parking to be available as areas rather than (entrance) point</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, all locations (whether public or private) come through, but you can specify a filtering option (as <a href="http://bikedata.cyclestreets.net/cycleparking/">seen in the Bikedata example</a>) if you wish.</p>
<p>We perform a range of pre-processing to enhance the raw data:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the location is on private land, but the parking itself is not marked as such, we pre-process the data to mark it as private</li>
<li>For larger installations such as <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/location/74187/">cycle parks</a>, we use the entrance point as its location, rather than the centre-point</li>
<li>We convert data defined as either points or areas into a unified set of points</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/location/74187/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3266" src="/wp-content/uploads/cyclepark-e1504015502778.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="202" /></a></p>
<p>This data is all possible thanks to the power of OpenStreetMap. We regularly import OSM data, perform a range of processing on it (e.g. convert locations on private land into private POIs, determining entrance points, etc.), and turn this into an indexed API.</p>
<p>Our API is a flexible, robust and well-maintained interface (it has been running since 2010). If you need a Service Level Agreement, or are likely to require high volumes of requests, we can also provide the API on a contractual basis.</p>
<p>To get started, just <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/apply/">obtain an API key</a>, and set your application to make API calls to the <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/v2/pois.locations/">POIs API</a> and render the GeoJSON response on your map.</p>
<p>If you would like to request any enhancements to the API, to cover your use-case, do <a href="/contacts/">get in touch</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you have any existing cycle parking data, we are happy to provide advice on how to make it available.</p>
